## Lessons Learned

1. What did I learn while building this project? 
    * I get used to more to Poetry
    * I increased my know how about relational databases for big projects


2. What challenges did I face and how did you overcome them?
   * My biggest challenge was about microservices. I knew definition, but I had no experience on it.
   * As a solution full one week I've done reading on microservices.io then I connected with Chris Richardson via Linkedin and find out answers for my question.
   * Finally, after 1 week I was able to design my architecture and database diagram
